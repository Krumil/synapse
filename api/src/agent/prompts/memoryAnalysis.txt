Analyze the conversation below and identify any important information about the user that should be stored for future interactions.
Extract specific details about:
- Investment history
- Assets of interest
- Financial constraints
- Time horizons
- Risk events
- Any other important information that would help personalize future interactions

For each piece of information, determine an appropriate key with the prefix "info_" and provide the value.
Format your response as a valid JSON object with the structure:
{
  "items": [
    {"key": "info_key_name", "value": "extracted information"},
    {"key": "info_another_key", "value": "another piece of information"}
  ]
}

If no important information is found, return {"items": []}.
